    "reviews": [
      "Bobst Library has been my second home throughout my time at NYU. The building itself is incredible—imagine studying under a 12-story atrium with a stunning geometric ceiling! The space is so inspiring and keeps you focused. They have endless resources, from rare books to cutting-edge research tools. And if you need a quiet spot, there are multiple silent floors where you can truly get in the zone.",
      "Love the atmosphere.",
      "Could use more seating.",
      "The library is a must for anyone serious about studying. You have access to millions of books, digital resources, and archives—everything you’d ever need. That said, Bobst is popular, and sometimes it’s hard to find a good seat, especially during finals. The views from the upper floors of Washington Square Park are a big plus!"
